# Mobile_Price_Range_Prediction_Classification_Project
The project aims to analyze sales data of mobile phones to uncover the relationship between various features of the phones (such as RAM, internal memory, etc.) and their selling prices. Rather than predicting the exact price of a phone, the goal is to categorize phones into price ranges, indicating their relative price points.
